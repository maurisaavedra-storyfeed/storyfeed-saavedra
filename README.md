// DON'T MODIFY PACKAGES FOLDER
// The only four documents we modified in packages folder are:
// storyfeed-saavedra/packages/telescope-posts/lib/menus.js  (starting in line 19 to add icon menu in mobile)
// storyfeed-saavedra/packages/telescope-tags/lib/client/templates/autoform_category.js
// storyfeed-saavedra/packages/telescope-tags/lib/client/templates/autoform_category.html (the two above we changed to set the tags in different categories and add geopluign into the categories)
// storyfeed-saavedra/packages/telescope-comments/lib/comments.js (in this document we changed the line: 67 rows from 5 to 2 to minimize the size of the comments-submit box)
//
