// DON'T MODIFY PACKAGES FOLDER
// The only four documents we modified in packages folder are:
// storyfeed-saavedra/packages/telescope-theme-base/lib/client/scss/specific/_layout.scss (to change the background color when embed)
// storyfeed-saavedra/packages/meteor-accounts-t9n-master/t9n/en.coffee - es.coffee (we can change all in this folder)
// storyfeed-saavedra/packages/Detect-language-master/detectlanguage.js  (starting in line 9 to add t9n capability)
// storyfeed-saavedra/packages/telescope-posts/lib/menus.js  (starting in line 19 to add icon menu in mobile)
// storyfeed-saavedra/packages/telescope-tags/lib/client/templates/autoform_category.js
// storyfeed-saavedra/packages/telescope-tags/lib/client/templates/autoform_category.html (the two above we changed to set the tags in different categories and add geopluign into the categories)
// storyfeed-saavedra/packages/telescope-comments/lib/comments.js (in this document we changed the line: 67 rows from 5 to 2 to minimize the size of the comments-submit box)
